#### Simulation of a Markov chain walk in a binary tree

File *mcBinTree.py* runs several simulations and takes the mean of
each experiment and outputs the plot of the mean and the stopping 
time of the simulation.

File *oneRunMC.py* is just a single experiment of the simulation.

File *mcSim.py* shows how fast in Total Variation norm does the 
Markov Chain converges to the stationary distribution.

File *makeTree.py* build a special tree data structure.

File *mcMatrix.py* builds a matrix from a tree created by *makeTree.py*.

File *totalVariationNorm.py* has two of the ways to measure the TV
norm.

**Note:** the n-arity of the tree can be changed, but the code might 
have to be changed a bit.
